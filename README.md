Profit Leakage & Operational Inefficiency Analysis


1. Business Problem

Despite steady revenue growth, the company is experiencing inconsistent profitability across regions and product categories. Management suspects hidden profit leakage caused by excessive discounting, high shipping costs, and operational inefficiencies but lacks clear visibility into where and why profit is being lost.

2. What is Profit Leakage

Profit leakage occurs when revenue-generating orders result in low or negative profit due to factors such as high discounts, excessive shipping costs, product-level inefficiencies, or operational issues.

This project aims to answer the following key business questions:

Which regions, categories, and sub-categories contribute most to profit leakage?
How do discounts impact profit margins?
