Profit Leakage & Operational Inefficiency Analysis


1. Business Problem

Despite steady revenue growth, the company is experiencing inconsistent profitability across regions and product categories. Management suspects hidden profit leakage caused by excessive discounting, high shipping costs, and operational inefficiencies but lacks clear visibility into where and why profit is being lost.

2. What is Profit Leakage

Profit leakage occurs when revenue-generating orders result in low or negative profit due to factors such as high discounts, excessive shipping costs, product-level inefficiencies, or operational issues.

3. Business Questions

This project aims to answer the following key business questions:

Which regions, categories, and sub-categories contribute most to profit leakage?


How do discounts impact profit margins?

Which customers generate high revenue but low or negative profit?

How does shipping mode affect profitability?

Are there products with strong sales but consistently poor profit performance?

4. Key Metrics

The analysis focuses on the following metrics:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Profit Margin (%)

Discount (%)

Shipping Cost

Loss-Making Orders (Profit < 0)


## Key Insights & Recommendations

- The Tables sub-category generates high revenue but operates at an average margin of –24%, making it the largest source of profit leakage.
- Product-level analysis revealed specific table products with extreme discounting (40–60%) and deeply negative margins.
- Loss-making products were classified into repricing or discontinuation actions, enabling targeted product strategy decisions instead of blanket category changes.
